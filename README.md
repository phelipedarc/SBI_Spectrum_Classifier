# DESGW-SPECTRO Spectrum Classifiers
This project is a collaboration to develop two spectrum classifiers using Simulation Based Inference (Deep Learning). The first classifier distinguishes between Supernovas and Kilonovas, while the second classifier classifies Supernova spectra as either Type I or Type II.
## Usage:
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the SBI for classification and how to preprocess the spectra data. It serves as a guide on how to input the spectrum into the model for classification.
### Installation
To use this notebook, please ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SBI
To install the SBI package (https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/): 
'''
pip install sbi
'''
